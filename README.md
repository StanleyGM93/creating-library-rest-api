# Creating Library REST API

## Purpose and Method

This project was designed as a taster for connecting frontend code with backend code. In this project I created four functions for a library to complete CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations with their books. The bulk of the code was supplied by [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com) with instructions on how to set up the project. In this project I specifically worked on the frontend/src/api/books.js file to create the link between the frontend and backend. Once this was completed I completed some minor debugging to get the project to successfully compile.
